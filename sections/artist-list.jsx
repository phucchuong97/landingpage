                    Alexandra Oleksyuk is a Ukrainian 2D artist and graphic
                    designer who has been drawing all her life, constantly
                    inspired by the artistic city around her. She attended art
                    school in her hometown of Ivano-Frankivsk and later at the
                    Institute of Arts of the Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian
                    National University. Since then, she’s worked as an artist,
                    a graphic artist, and a fine arts teacher. After years of
                    working as a designer, Oleksyuk changed course to
                    communicate with children and their families through the
                    language of art. Her biggest dream is to continue on this
                    path of children’s illustration and create work for and
                    about children.{' '}

                    As the lead designer of the book “Angels”, Oleksyuk feels
                    this is her life’s work, to speak to the children of the
                    world on meaningful matters, and to spread awareness about
                    the war in her home country of Ukraine. Teaching children
                    about war and its effect on people and other children isn’t
                    easy, but Oleksyuk believes that when we take the time to
                    show them what’s happening they grow up to be empathetic
                    people who can be a force for good.{' '}

                    Megumi Arai is a Japanese artist and mother, who has
                    wandered the world, finally landing in Southern California.
                    Aria is a freelance illustrator who’s mastered finding joy
                    and the spark of creativity through ordinary things that
                    make up this incredible gift of life. The greatest
                    inspiration for her work is nature, and she believes that
                    highlighting nature can transport us to the curiosity and
                    innocence of childhood. She hopes this book, “Angels”, can
                    blend both education and awareness with inspiration and hope
                    for the future.

                    who has over a decade of steady experience in the field of
                    art. Her vast expertise in both painting, continuous line
                    drawing, and Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator gives her
                    versatility through her skills. Her single-line drawing
                    style allows for originality and modernism whilst still
                    looking minimalistic. As this style lends itself to both
                    realism and fantasy it can convey a variety of subjects all
                    while looking fresh, original, and clean. Her style has been
                    seen in interior designs, web designs, and book designs such
                    as is seen in the book “Angels”.
